# Snake
Snake World is a simple snake game implementation in JAVA. 

The project implements the basic snake game where is goal score more points by eating food.

## Level Editor
In addition to the basic snake game there is a level editor implemented where the player can edit his/her own
levels and can play that level instantly after the editing is done.

### To Do
Currently level editor only works for a single window size. Scaling of the blocks for different levels are
yet to be implemented.

Have fun.
